The user wants a changelog for the FTB web app based on a single commit from the past week. Let me analyze the commit:

Commit: `d3ab206 2026-01-31 cahngelog delete branch if it exists (#171)`

This appears to be about:
- Deleting a branch if it exists (likely in a CI/CD or automation context)
- The commit message has a typo "cahngelog" instead of "changelog"
- It's PR #171

Since there's only one commit, I need to:
1. Group this into an appropriate change type
2. Create a YAML frontmatter with the required fields
3. Write a brief paragraph about release highlights

The date is 2026-01-31, so the week would be something like "January 31, 2026" or the week ending/starting around that date.

Change type analysis:
- This sounds like a CI/CD improvement or automation fix
- "delete branch if it exists" suggests it's preventing errors when trying to delete a branch that might already be gone, or ensuring cleanup happens properly
- Could be categorized as: improvement, fix, or chore (CI/CD)

Given it's about branch deletion logic, likely in a GitHub Actions workflow or similar, I'd categorize it as either:
- `improvement` (if it's making the cleanup more robust)
- `fix` (if it's fixing an error that occurs when the branch doesn't exist)
- `chore` (if it's maintenance/CI work)

The phrase "delete branch if it exists" suggests it's adding a check to prevent failures when the branch is already deleted or doesn't exist, so it's likely a robustness improvement or fix.

Let me structure this:

Week: Since the date is 2026-01-31, I'll use "January 31, 2026" or "Week of January 31, 2026"

Title: Something like "CI/CD Branch Cleanup Improvements" or "Automated Branch Deletion Fixes"

Summary: One sentence about improving CI/CD workflows or branch management.

Changes:
- Type: improvement or fix
- Title: Safe Branch Deletion in CI/CD
- Description: Added check to delete branch only if it exists to prevent workflow failures during cleanup operations.

Wait, looking at the commit message again: "cahngelog delete branch if it exists" - this might actually be related to changelog generation automation? Like when generating a changelog, delete the branch if it already exists?

Actually, looking closely: "cahngelog delete branch if it exists" - this could mean:
1. It's a changelog-related change that deletes branches if they exist
2. Or it's a typo and should be "changelog: delete branch if it exists"

Given the context of FTB (Feed The Beast - a Minecraft modpack launcher/platform), this is likely related to their web app's CI/CD pipeline for generating changelogs or releases.

So the change is: When generating a changelog or during a release process, the system now checks if a branch exists before trying to delete it, preventing errors.

Type: improvement (making the process more robust) or fix (fixing a bug where it would fail if branch didn't exist)

I'll go with "improvement" as it's enhancing the robustness.

Now for the format:

---
week: "January 31, 2026"
date: 2026-01-31
title: "CI/CD Pipeline Robustness Improvements"
summary: "Enhanced automation workflows to handle branch cleanup more gracefully."
isMajor: false
author: "FTB Team"
changes:
  - type: improvement
    title: "Safe Branch Deletion in Automation Workflows"
    description: "Updated CI/CD pipelines to check for branch existence before deletion, preventing workflow failures when attempting to clean up non-existent branches during changelog generation or release processes."
---

This week focused on improving the reliability of our automated workflows. The team implemented safer branch deletion logic to ensure continuous integration processes complete successfully even when expected branches have already been removed.

Wait, I need to make sure I include ALL changes. There's only one commit provided, so that's the only change to include.

Let me double-check the commit message interpretation:
- "cahngelog delete branch if it exists" 
- Could this mean: "Changelog: Delete branch if it exists" - i.e., this commit is part of a changelog PR and the actual change is about deleting branches?

Yes, that's likely. The commit is implementing logic to delete a branch if it exists (probably in a GitHub Action), and the commit message starts with "cahngelog" which might indicate the area of work or could be a typo for "changelog".

Given the constraints, I should stick to describing what the commit clearly states: adding logic to delete a branch if it exists.

Final check of the format requirements:
- YAML frontmatter with exact fields: week, date, title, summary, isMajor, author, changes
- changes is an array with type, title, description
- Then a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences max) after the frontmatter
- Return ONLY the changelog content

Let me verify the date format. The commit date is 2026-01-31, so:
- week: "January 31, 2026" (or "Week of January 31, 2026" but the example shows "[Month Day, Year]")
- date: 2026-01-31

Title should be brief and descriptive.

Summary should be one sentence.

isMajor: false (this seems like a minor CI/CD tweak)

author: "FTB Team"

changes:
- type: improvement (or fix, but improvement seems better for defensive programming)
- title: "Conditional Branch Deletion"
- description: "Modified automation scripts to verify branch existence before attempting deletion, ensuring robust cleanup operations in CI/CD workflows."

Paragraph:
"This release includes improvements to our automated pipeline infrastructure. The changes ensure more reliable branch management during continuous integration processes, reducing failures due to race conditions or previously cleaned resources."

Actually, looking at the single commit again, maybe I should be more specific about what branch deletion refers to. Without more context, I'll keep it general but accurate to the commit message.

One final check: The user said "Include ALL changes" but only provided one commit. So I must include that one commit.

Also, "Group related commits into single entries" - with only one commit, this is trivial.

The format must be exact. Let me construct it:

---
week: "January 31, 2026"
date: 2026-01-31
title: "CI/CD Pipeline Reliability Improvements"
summary: "Enhanced automation workflows with safer branch deletion logic to prevent integration failures."
isMajor: false
author: "FTB Team"
changes:
  - type: improvement
    title: "Conditional Branch Cleanup"
    description: "Updated CI/CD automation to check if a branch exists before attempting deletion, preventing workflow errors during cleanup operations when branches have already been removed or do not exist."
---

This week's updates focus on improving the robustness of our automated deployment and release processes. By implementing defensive checks in our branch management workflows, we've eliminated potential failure points that could interrupt continuous integration pipelines during changelog generation or release preparation.

This looks good. It covers the single commit provided, follows all formatting rules, and provides appropriate context. </think> ---
